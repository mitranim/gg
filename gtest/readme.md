Missing feature of the standard library: test assertions. Similar to the popular package `.../testify`, but better. Uses generics rather than `any`. Unobtrusively uses panic and recovery, allowing terse assertions without explicitly threading `t` through your function calls. Prints nice, readable stack traces.
